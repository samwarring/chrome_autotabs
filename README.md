# Tab Harmony

*A place for every tab, and every tab in its place.*

Do you have too many tabs? Tab Harmony is a Chrome extension that keeps your tabs organized!

## Features

* Tabs are sorted alphabetically according to their *reversed domain name*. Instead of sorting `mail.google.com` under "M" and `calendar.google.com` under "C", Tab Harmony treats these domains as `google.mail` and `google.calendar`. They are always sorted next to each other under "G" for Google!

* When you have lots of open tabs that share a common *domain suffix* (for example, `*.stackoverflow.com`), Tab Harmony puts them in a new tab group named after that suffix (in this example, `stackoverflow`). By default, at least 4 tabs must share a suffix before they are grouped. This value is configurable as well as the colors assigned to each tab group!

* **ALL** tabs are sorted and grouped *every* time you navigate to a new URL. No need to press a hotkey! Stop organizing your tabs by hand - let Tab Harmony organize them for you!
